# Implementation-of-Neural-Style-Transfer-in-Keras

Neural Style Transfer (NST) is an optimization technique used to take two images - a content image and a style reference image and blend them together so the output image looks like the content image, but painted in the style of the style reference image.

Here, a pretrained VGG19 model is used to perform style transfer using the Keras framework. The style transfer is achieved through the optimization of a loss function that has 3 components - style loss, content loss and total variation loss.
